This repository demonstrates a common Perl error: accessing an array element beyond its defined index. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version that handles the out-of-bounds access gracefully.  The error can lead to unpredictable program behavior, especially when combined with other operations, highlighting the importance of careful array index handling.
